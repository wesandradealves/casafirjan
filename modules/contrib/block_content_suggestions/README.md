INTRODUCTION
------------

The Block content suggestions module provides support for custom templates for
custom block types created by Drupal administrators. This feature is disabled by
default by Drupal core.

However, under certain circumstances, this can be a good helper for adding more
flexibility to block types. It also enhances themers experience when working
with multiple view display modes for blocks.
