INTRODUCTION
------------

The Dynamic Breadcrumb module provides an advanced way to change labels of items
generated by Drupal's core breadcrumb following the best-practices
of altering breadcrumbs on Drupal.

The module uses Token UI to give the users a better UX when it comes to
customizing the breadcrumb.

For more informations, see the full description on
https://www.drupal.org/project/dynamic_breadcrumb

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires Token UI module in order to use
the configuration form properly.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install the Dynamic Breadcrumb module as you would normally install a
contributed Drupal module.
Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.
The module requires Token UI as a dependency on Composer,
so it will be automatically installed.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

    1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the module.
    2. Navigate to Administration > Configuration > User interface >
     Dynamic breadcrumb.
    3. Configure the entity types that you want to be used by the module from
      Administration > Configuration > User interface > Dynamic breadcrumb ->
      Entity Types Settings
    4. Configure the entity types that you want to be used by the module from
      Administration > Configuration > User interface > Dynamic breadcrumb ->
      Breadcrumbs settings


Once on the configuration page, you should have a form with four collapsible
fieldsets for the following entity types (Node, Media, Taxonomy term and User),
each fieldset contains checkboxes referring to bundles and a hyperlink
(Browse available tokens), once a checkbox is checked,
a required textfield will appear below the checkbox which allows you to type
the custom breadcrumb value.
Tokens can be used and they will be replaced automatically by the dynamic value.
